  { "id": 3, "type": "text", "text": "Here you go! Let's work with the car sketch. It has the basic outlines of the car body, a window, and wheels.", "sender": "user" },
  { "id": 3.5, "type": "interactive", "component": "CarSketch"},
  { "id": 4, "type": "text", "text": "Great! So the AI looks at the sketch and tries to understand it by identifying its patterns and figuring out what each part represents. Let’s break down how it does this.", "sender": "ai" },
  { "id": 5, "type": "text", "text": "First, it looks for basic shapes like rectangles, circles, and ovals and then tries to guess what each shape is. ", "sender": "ai" },
  { "id": 5.1, "text": "For instance, it might see circles at the bottom of the sketch and guess that they are the wheels. If it sees rounded shape above those circles, it might think it is the window.", "sender": "ai", "type": "text" },
  { "id": 5.2, "text": "It also uses clues from the sketch to understand the context. For instance, there are smaller circles within the larger circles, AI might understand these as hubcaps on the wheels.", "sender": "ai", "type": "text" },
  { "id": 5.5, "type": "interactive", "component": "STIBox1" },
  { "id": 6, "text": "So, how does the AI decide on the colours for each part of the sketch?", "sender": "user", "type": "text" },
  { "id": 7, "text": "The AI has seen a large dataset of images and learned what colors are commonly used for different parts of a car.", "sender": "ai", "type": "text"},
  { "id": 7.1, "text": " For instance, windows are usually transparent or tinted, and tires are most commonly black. Then AI uses its understanding to pick appropriate colors for your image.", "sender": "ai", "type": "text"},
  { "id": 7.5, "type": "interactive", "component": "STIBox2" },
  { "id": 8, "text": "Additionally, when using text input along with the sketch, the AI interprets the text to guide the image creation.", "sender": "ai", "type": "text" },
  { "id": 8.1, "text": "For instance, you might specify that you want “a car on the road”, and the AI will adjust the output background accordingly.", "sender": "ai", "type": "text"},
  { "id": 8.2, "text": "The text input will communicate specific expectations for the resulting image like the color of the car or the background settings.", "sender":"ai", "type": "text"},
  { "id": 8.5, "type": "interactive", "component": "STIBox3" },
  { "id": 9, "text": "It looks great!", "sender": "user", "type": "text"},
  { "id": 9.1, "text": "Besides using your text input as guidance for generating a new image, something called “creativity strength” will also alter the image's outcome.", "sender": "ai", "type": "text"},
  { "id": 10, "text": "The parameter “creativity strength” decides how much freedom you want for AI to create.", "sender": "ai", "type": "text" },
  { "id": 11, "text": "If you set the creativity to low, that means the image will be more similar to your sketch, while if you set the creativity level to high, it means you will give AI more freedom to decide what will be on the image.", "sender": "ai", "type": "text"},

  { "id": 12, "text": "The AI has learned from many different images and styles. When AI is allowed to be more creative, it mixes these ideas in new and interesting ways. And that's it! We've gone from a simple sketch to a detailed picture.", "sender": "ai", "type": "text" },
